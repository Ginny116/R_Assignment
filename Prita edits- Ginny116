R_Assignment - Edits Prita
The code looks good and you finished it using minimal lines of codes.

May be you can add more information about how you downloaded the files or read fang_et al and SNP files? It will help the other person to run the code independently if needed. 
It would also be helpful if you could mention the additional packages you used for the code. Is the melt function available with tidyverse or dplyr?
I could not run it using the same code so may be I need to install some package so that R can identify melt function.

For the graphs may be you can add little details like ggtitle- Distribution of the graph, xlabel = Chromosome, ylabel = Position so that it is easy to interpret the graph.
